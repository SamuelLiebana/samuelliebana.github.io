I am a Research Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience working with [Andrew Saxe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/andrew-saxe) at UCL. My work lies at the intersection of theoretical and experimental neuroscience, aiming to uncover the computational and biological principles of individual/collective learning in the brain.

I completed my PhD in Neuroscience at [DPAG, University of Oxford](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/) supervised by [Armin Lak](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/armin-lak), [Andrew Saxe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/andrew-saxe), and [Rafal Bogacz](https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/people/prof-rafal-bogacz). During my PhD, I studied the computational role of dopamine in long-term learning.

I am funded by the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) and Gatsby Charitable Foundation.
