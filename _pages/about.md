Hi, this is Sam! I am a PhD student working with [Armin Lak](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/armin-lak) and [Andrew Saxe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/andrew-saxe) in Oxford and the Gatsby Unit at UCL. My work lies at the intersection of theoretical and experimental neuroscience. I am currently working on modelling the role of striatal dopamine through learning in a perceptual decision-making paradigm for mice. I am interested in discovering the general principles underlying learning both on the cortical and subcortical levels.
