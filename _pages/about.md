Hi, this is Sam! I am a Research Fellow in Theoretical Neuroscience working with [Andrew Saxe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/andrew-saxe) in the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL. My work lies at the intersection of theoretical and experimental neuroscience. I am currently working on uncovering the principles of individual and collective learning in the brain. Feel free to contact me to discuss ideas!
