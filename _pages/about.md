Hi, this is Sam! I am a PhD student supervised by [Armin Lak](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/armin-lak), [Andrew Saxe](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/people/andrew-saxe) and [Rafal Bogacz](https://www.mrcbndu.ox.ac.uk/people/prof-rafal-bogacz) in Oxford and the Gatsby Unit at UCL. My work lies at the intersection between theoretical and experimental neuroscience. I am currently working on modelling the role of striatal dopamine in learning through a perceptual decision-making paradigm for mice. I am interested in discovering the general principles underlying learning both on the cortical and subcortical levels. Feel free to contact me to discuss ideas!
